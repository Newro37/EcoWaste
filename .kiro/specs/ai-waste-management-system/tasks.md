# Implementation Plan: AI Waste Management System

## Overview

This implementation plan covers building a full-stack Next.js 14 application with role-based access control, waste reporting, collection workflows, and an admin verification system. The application uses TypeScript, Prisma ORM with Neon PostgreSQL, BetterAuth for authentication, and Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP delivery
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and provide opportunities for user feedback
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties with 100+ iterations
- Unit and integration tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The implementation follows a bottom-up approach: infrastructure → authentication → UI → features → testing
- All server actions must enforce role-based authorization before modifying data
- All database transactions must be atomic (all operations succeed or all fail)
- All UI components must use Shadcn UI with emerald brand color
- All pages must be responsive at mobile (≤640px) and desktop (≥1024px) breakpoints
