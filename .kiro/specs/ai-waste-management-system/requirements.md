# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agentic Waste Management Web App is a role-based platform built with Next.js 14 (App Router), BetterAuth, Prisma ORM, Neon (PostgreSQL), Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. The system enables three distinct user roles — Reporter, Collector, and Admin — to participate in a coordinated waste reporting, collection, and verification workflow. Reporters submit waste reports with location and classification data, Collectors claim and fulfill those reports, and Admins oversee user approvals and report verification. A points-based incentive system rewards participation. The landing page features a Waste Classification Gallery, and the UI uses an emerald brand color with Shadcn UI components throughout.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-defined database schema, so that all user, report, and feedback data is stored consistently and relationally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL define a User model with fields: id (unique identifier), email (unique, max 255 characters), name (non-empty, max 100 characters), role (enum: REPORTER, COLLECTOR, ADMIN), status (enum: PENDING, APPROVED), and points (integer, default 0, minimum 0, maximum 999999).
2. THE System SHALL define a WasteReport model with fields: id (unique identifier), location (non-empty String, max 500 characters), wasteType (enum: ORGANIC, PLASTIC, METAL, E_WASTE, HAZARDOUS), amount (non-empty String, max 100 characters), status (enum: PENDING, COLLECTED, VERIFIED), reporterId (foreign key to User, non-nullable), collectorId (foreign key to User, nullable), and createdAt (DateTime, auto-set on creation).
3. THE System SHALL define a Feedback model with fields: id (unique identifier), reportId (foreign key to WasteReport, non-nullable), content (non-empty String, max 500 characters), and createdAt (DateTime, auto-set on creation).
4. THE System SHALL enforce referential integrity such that: deleting a User with existing WasteReports as reporter is prevented or cascades to delete those reports; a WasteReport's reporterId must reference an existing User; a WasteReport's collectorId, when set, must reference an existing User.
5. THE System SHALL enforce a unique constraint on the User model's email field so that no two User records share the same email address.
6. THE Prisma Schema SHALL be the single source of truth for all database models and migrations, and all schema changes SHALL be applied via Prisma migrations.

---

### Requirement 2: User Registration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to register an account with a chosen role, so that I can access the features appropriate to my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor submits a registration form, THE System SHALL create a new User record with the provided email, name, password (hashed), and selected role (one of REPORTER, COLLECTOR, ADMIN).
2. WHEN a visitor submits a registration form, THE System SHALL validate that: the email is a valid email format, the name is non-empty, the role is one of the allowed enum values, and the password is at least 8 characters long; IF any validation fails, THE System SHALL display an error message indicating the cause of failure without creating a User record.
3. WHEN a new User is created with role COLLECTOR, THE System SHALL set the User's status to PENDING.
4. WHEN a new User is created with role REPORTER or ADMIN, THE System SHALL set the User's status to APPROVED.
5. WHEN a visitor submits valid login credentials, THE System SHALL use BetterAuth to create a new session for the User.
6. WHEN an authenticated User logs out, THE System SHALL use BetterAuth to invalidate the current session.
7. THE System SHALL include the authenticated User's role and status in the session payload so that middleware and server actions can read them without an additional database query.
8. IF a visitor submits a registration form with an email that already exists, THEN THE System SHALL return an error message indicating the cause of failure without creating a duplicate User record.
9. IF a visitor submits a login form with invalid credentials, THEN THE System SHALL return an error message indicating the cause of failure without creating a session.

### Requirement 3: Middleware and Route Access Control

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want route-level access control enforced by middleware, so that users can only access pages appropriate to their role and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated User with role REPORTER accesses a route under `/dashboard/reporter/`, THE System SHALL allow access.
2. WHEN an authenticated User without role REPORTER attempts to access a route under `/dashboard/reporter/`, THE System SHALL redirect the User to `/dashboard/collector/` if their role is COLLECTOR, or to `/admin/` if their role is ADMIN.
3. WHEN an authenticated User with role COLLECTOR and status APPROVED accesses a route under `/dashboard/collector/`, THE System SHALL allow access.
4. WHEN an authenticated User with role COLLECTOR and status PENDING accesses a route under `/dashboard/collector/`, THE System SHALL redirect the User to the `/pending-approval` page.
5. WHEN an authenticated User with role ADMIN accesses a route under `/admin/`, THE System SHALL allow access.
6. WHEN an authenticated User without role ADMIN attempts to access a route under `/admin/`, THE System SHALL redirect the User to `/dashboard/reporter/` if their role is REPORTER, or to `/dashboard/collector/` if their role is COLLECTOR.
7. WHEN an unauthenticated visitor attempts to access any route under `/dashboard/` or `/admin/`, THE System SHALL redirect the visitor to the `/login` page.
8. WHEN an authenticated User with role COLLECTOR and status PENDING attempts to access any protected route other than `/pending-approval`, THE System SHALL redirect the User to `/pending-approval`.
